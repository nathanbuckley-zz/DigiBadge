..............................Digital Badge v1.0 Readme..............................

This is the Project description and bits you should know when Building your own Digital Badge.

This Project started off due to a comment made by a friend of mine and followed on the idea that it would accompany me round all the events of the Month long Brighton Digital Festival. The two constraints i had where Money and Time. I had very little fee time so it had to be a very quick build. After a quick thought this is what i came up with.....


........................................Parts.......................................... 


Seeduino (cheapest arduino clone board could find at the time)
1.8inch tft adafruit Breakout board.(For ease of build more than anything)
Micro SD card. (storage space not issue. used on lying around from old phone)
Altoid Tin
Tiny bit of protoboard
Solid core wire / Jumper cables
Bright LED (Own Choice of Color)
9v Bettery adapter to Jack
9v Battery
little bit of proto board
Random bit of acrlic
pin to attach finished badge
cheap/ free bits for decoration
Paint
Ductape
Doublesided foam servo tape
tiny nuts,Bolts and Threded bar.(had some 2m bar and bolts lying around)

..............................Things to note ....................................

When making the images for your badge, use Pixlr.com for a free easy choice of image editing tool. Create a blank canvas 126 x 160 . Befor saving the image rotate it 90 degrees clockwise and save as a .BMP . This creates a working image. Have added mine the the repository for examples. 

Make sure you go through the adafruit tutorial on your screen and test you build over and over again. It is importat to got through the adafruit tutorials on the Breakout screen so you know which librarys to download to get it working properly. 

A lot of stuff i used to build this where scavanged from other projects or just Junk lying around. For this reason it was the cheapist project i ever finished. I do plan on making a v2 shortly with a lot more features and much smaller so watch this space. 

If i had a little more time i would have removed the headers from the seeduino and soldered the main wires to the board. Would have save a lot of space in the tin.
